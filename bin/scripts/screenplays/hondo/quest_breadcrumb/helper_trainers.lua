-- Bread Crumb Quest: Help the player find the profession trainers.
-- R. Bassett Jr. www.tpot.ca
-- June 2016
--
-- This file can be used a template for other "bread crumb quests" that takes place on the same planet as its quest giver.
-- 1. Replace all instances of HelperTrainersScreenPlay and helpertrainers_convo_handler, and change the value of questName, className, with something unique.
-- 2. Make a custom character and conversation for that character. Keep in mind the important convo steps that trigger the quest actions.
-- 3. Spawn your character in the spawnMobiles() function.
-- 4. Customize the questConfig table to your liking.
-- That gets you a new quest with minimal effort. As the quest is self contained, not part of a standard framework, you can add new functionality as you see fit, confident that your mods won't break something else.
-- Note that this quest method does not require a client side update, provided your convo lua file is hand made with NPC customDialogText and reply options.
-- This system was originally based upon the race track logic created by SWGEmu.
